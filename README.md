## Project Overview
The goal is to create pivot tables and visualizations in Excel that present key insights and KPIs derived from the analysis of a sales dataset.


## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create privot tables and visualisations using Excel that shows insights and KPIs generated from the analysis of a sales dataset.


## Data Sources
The dataset used in this data visualisation has been provided by 10Alytics. 


## Data Preprocessing
The data underwent loading and transformation in Microsoft Excel. Cleaning procedures were implemented, and missing values were addressed to ensure data consistency.


## Data Analysis
To properly analyse the data, pivot tables were created and DAX was used to generate calculated columns and measures that helped generate insightful KPIs to the data.


## Data Visualization
The findings were encapsulated in a single-page report, presenting a visual representation of key insights derived from the analysis.


## Key Insights
- The data spans a fiscal period of one year (July 2015 - July 2016).
- A total of 34,866 transactions were recorded.
- Total profit amounted to $2,261,609.
- The "Adult" age group constituted the highest profit-generating customer segment.
- Phones emerged as the top-selling product category, while Clothing ranked as the least sold.

## Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **Targeted Marketing:** Given that the "Adult" age group contributes significantly to profits, consider tailoring marketing strategies specifically to this demographic.
- **Product Focus:** Since Phones are the top-selling category, consider investing more resources in marketing and inventory management for this product line. Conversely, evaluate strategies to boost sales in the Clothing category.
- **Seasonal Analysis:** Explore potential seasonality factors influencing transactions and profits. This understanding can guide targeted promotions or inventory adjustments during specific periods.
- **Customer Retention:** Identify patterns in customer behavior to develop retention strategies. This could involve loyalty programs or personalized promotions for frequent customers.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Establish a routine for updating and monitoring the dashboard to ensure ongoing relevance and timely responsiveness to evolving market trends.

By implementing these recommendations, the organisation can leverage the insights gained to optimize marketing efforts, enhance product offerings, and foster sustained profitability.
